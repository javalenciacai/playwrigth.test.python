# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '0 13 * * 1-5'
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
